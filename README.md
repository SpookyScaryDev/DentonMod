# doom3.glp
This is just a quick fork of the original DOOM 3 source release.
I have retargeted the project files and fixed building the SDK on Windows, to make mod development for the original game easier.
However the game exe is a bit of a pain to get working due to changes in MFC and other Windows libraries.
