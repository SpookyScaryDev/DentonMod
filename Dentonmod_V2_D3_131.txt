Dentonmod source code V2.0 (Doom 3 V1.3.1 Compatible):

The source contains changes related to dentonmod. 

Please accept my appologies, first of all. I havent included much of the comments in the source code (I am planning to include them though). If you have any doubts mail me at clone_jc_denton@yahoo.com.

While adding changes to the source code, at certain point in time, I decided to use a macro  _DENTONMOD to keep track of changes I made. 

e.g.
#ifdef _DENTONMOD 
	changed line;
#else 
	original line;
#endif

 but the problem is, changes made since then, use that macro; where as the changes made before I added the macro, does not use the macro. 

If you are compiling, please note that, you'll need following two macros #defined (in the property pages->Configuration Properties->C/C++->Prepocessors in case of visual studio) 

_DENTONMOD
_PORTALSKY
